# README

A project to learn rails from The Odin Project. Specifically, it will be a hands-on, low instruction, build to get more familiar with the basics. And is to include a secure user feature which will make me more familiar with the devise gem and its methods.

Expectations:

First trying to do it with just the specs and without their instructions. I expect much googling, but all of the basics are floating around in my head at the moment and I think I have the know-how if not the specifics of how to do it.
